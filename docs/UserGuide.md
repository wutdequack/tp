## Auto-suggestions feature
For all the filter functions like `findbyname` and `deleteelderly`, the autosuggestions feature has been activated. If there is a match close to the query string that exists in the database, it will prompt you. 

Example: 

There exists an elderly called `johntan123`. A `deleteelderly` command is issued to delete an elderly with the username of `johntoh123`. 

```
> deleteelderly u/johntoh123
[*] I am sorry, did you mean: johntan123
```

The system will look in the system and suggest `johntan123` as the possible query term that the user should input. It will however **not execute the command to delete ** `johntan123`.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

**A**: You can use the `load` command to load the json file that you have stored using the `store` command.
It has been designed to **not be auto-save**, so you may specify where to save your file to.

**Q**: `AddMed` does not seem to work? 

**A**: Our program is created for a fast user. Hence, we made the assumption that the user will only
type in small letters instead of capitalising some words. Use `addmed` instead.

**Q**: How do I add new hospitals and doctors?

**A**: Our program is created to keep track of elderly records, not to add hospitals and doctors.
Hence, we have made the hospitals and doctors fixed for this program, with the assumption that only
these few hospitals and doctors are available to be selected. 

Of course, you are welcome to upgrade this to make it more scalable! :D

**Q**: It seems that I can type in numbers and gibberish for inputs like conditions and notes on
care for medium and high risk elderly?

**A**: Yes, but take note that this is **not a bug. It's a feature.** There are many times when the
helper needs to input numbers, medicine name and stuff into these fields. There is no way to check
and 100% guarantee the legitimacy of input. Hence, we decided to accept any input. We trust that the
input by the user will be legitimate, hence we accept anything from the user.
